                                    Sonal loves and respects her parents the most. She was born in Lucknow, India. She is Hanumanji's bhakt (a devotee of lord Hanuman) since childhood and she can recite the Hanuman Chalisa in less than 2 minutes. She grew up climbing trees and running other sorts of ruckus in town. She has a lot of close friends who admire her vivacious and mischievous nature; as they also know that inside she is a soft and caring person. She doesn't take kindly to people trying to upsell her (especially Rickshaw walas, Dominos Delivery guys and street peddlers marking up the MSRP on soft drinks). She adores desi mangoes and foreign strawberries. She basically loves anything sweet. Her soft hearted sweetness does not mean she is not determined! Her hard work, mental strength and determination has lead to her current position as Team Leader in JP Morgan Bangalore

                                Praful also loves and respects his parents the most. He was born on the banks of the river Ganges in Allahabad, India. He is Hanumanji's bhakt since birth also (But cannot recite the Hanuman Chalisa as fast as Sonal). He also grew up climbing trees, but throughout 3 different countries (Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines). Through his adventures, he made a lot of close friends. They admire his humour, affection and blatant honesty. He is a vegetarian that loves eating “Fake Meat” and anything fried and cheesy. After graduating high school in Malaysia, he went to America to pursue his degree and got stuck there by his ambition to change the world. He is now on the Product team at Runnable.com in San Francisco.

                            <p>They were introduced by their parents. Initially things were slow, Praful wrote to Sonal and she wrote back. They arranged to meet on Skype. One Skype session and it was BOOM (well at least according to Praful :)). They knew they were instantly attracted to each other. Both of them had a feeling of similarity in terms of character, morals and upbringing. It really seemed to them that this was not the first time they were meeting. After 8 months of extended Skype sessions (sometimes up to 20 hours a week!) and incessant Whatsapp messages, it finally came time to meet each other person. On February 25th 2014, they finally met. To their relief, they both acknowledged that reality was not so different when compared to Skype. Praful quickly decided to make a move and seal the deal fast </p>

                            <p> Praful set up a nice arrangement with Taj Vivanta in Bangalore. He got Sonal's favorite strawberries, candles and desserts. He escorted Sonal to the setup, engagement ring in hand. As Sonal sat down, Praful got on his knees and proposed. </p>
