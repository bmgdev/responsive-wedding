                                <img src="img/sarahThumb.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Sarah" />
                                Katie is most thankful to her parents for the gift of two loving big brothers &amp; five amazing role-model sisters. As the second-youngest, Sarah spent her childhood twirling &amp; dancing around, putting on talent shows for her parents &amp; grandparents. Her creative spirit and eye for design was established at a young age, as she highly disapproved of Mattel’s © furnishings and décor within her Barbie House. If Barbie needed an interior makeover (which was frequent) Sarah looked through Sunday newspaper ads &amp; IKEA magazines for inspiration, drew the new contents by hand and placed them as backdrops in the Barbie house. After graduation from Mater Dei High School, Sarah explored the metropolitan life in San Francisco and graduated with a BS in Interior Design from San Francisco State University. Sarah is adding to her vows that she will forever allow a one-room “man-den” with it’s contents and décor subject to Bradley’s discretion.</p>

                                Born in Mission Viejo, California, Bradley spent half of his life living with his mother in San Diego and half with his wonderful Wisconsin family. Bradley grew up playing ice hockey while secretly learning how to build computers. Half jock, half nerd, he has cultivated these interests well into his adult life, that make him who he is today. After his graduation from the University of San Francisco with a degree in Information Systems, Bradley worked for Yahoo! for seven years, and continued to explore the tech startup scene in  San Francisco. With an entrepreneurial spirit and passion for technology, Bradley now runs his own software company, Scal.io, building hand-crafted mobile,  web, and desktop apps for tech companies in the Silicon Valley and beyond. Bradley is adding to his vows a lifetime IT guarantee to Sarah, that he will be readily available 24/7 to troubleshoot... anything &amp; everything technical.</p>

                            <p>In 2010 the two were both wild and running free around San Francisco’s Marina District, as most singles do. Bradley was quite the bachelor- planning weekend getaways with friends, float trips, and taking last minute trips to Ibiza, Cabo, wherever the wind blew. Sarah was quite the bachelorette, wining and dining around San Francisco, on a strict agenda which included over-extending herself, saying yes to every social engagement that came her way.  After a mutual friend of the two suggested they would make a cute couple, a date was on the books and they began to discover just how compatible they were. In no time, they also discovered they were inseparable and very in love. The rest is history- they’ve shared some amazing adventures around the world, each other's toothbrushes, and now they’re ready to share the rest of their lives together, too.</p>

                            <h2>THE ENGAGEMENT</h2>
                            <p>Down in San Diego for a weekend to visit Bradley’s mom, the pair decided to spend the beautiful morning at Balboa Park. After returning to their hotel, Bradley asked Sarah to run up to their room for a bottle of wine that had been chilling. Bradley said he was going to ask concierge for a “wine opener” and that he’d meet her in the courtyard. As Sarah opened the door to the room, she “freaked out”, thinking she was in the wrong room. It was decorated with bouquets of her favorite flowers, decadent treats and champagne. Rose petals on the floor led her to the open balcony, and as she walked out she saw Bradley waiting for her down below, with a huge grin on his face. And like out of a fairy tale, Romeo asked Juliet to be his wife. She giggled, and said yes. Bradley had it all captured by a hidden, sniper-style photographer.</p>

                            <h2>HISTORY OF THE INN</h2>
                            <p>
                                Ninety years ago, construction began on La Morada (“dwelling” in Spanish), the first building in what would become Rancho Santa Fe. Now known as The Inn at Rancho Santa Fe, “The Inn” to locals, it was then a guesthouse for prospective land buyers, a place to “put them up” while they looked at lots owned by the Santa Fe Land Improvement Company. The company, a subsidiary of the Santa Fe Railway, had bought up parcels, planting eucalyptus trees for railroad spikes. But as history has so often shown, not everything goes according to plan. The wood, the company discovered, was too soft to hold the spikes. It was on to plan B.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That plan turned out to be fortuitous. It led to the master-planned community of Rancho Santa Fe, designed by Lilian Rice, a National City-born architect and U.C. Berkeley graduate, who would earn acclaim for her signature Spanish Colonial Revival style. Rice designed the village’s key commercial and residential buildings, many now considered so historically significant that they are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Throughout the decades The Inn has been a favorite destination for many years of famous and influential people.  In 1932, singer-actor Bing Crosby purchased one of Juan Osuna’s original adobes with 50 acres, and hired Lilian Rice as his architect. Legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright was married in the parlor of the Inn in 1928.   
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Just as the architecture of the missions tells a story about the history of California, so does Lilian Rice’s legendary design of The Inn. It is a perfect representation of old California charm and Rice's belief that true beauty lies in simplicity rather than ornateness. The Inn is a perfect reflection of Rice's dream - a place where time stands still amidst the simplistic, natural beauty that is Rancho Santa Fe.  &nbsp;&nbsp;
